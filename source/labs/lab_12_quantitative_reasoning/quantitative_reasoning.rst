Quantitative Reasoning Reflection
=================================

This is a reflection on quantitative reasoning. However, instead of turning it
in via a PDF or MS Word document, we'll turn it in as a text document.

Directions
----------

* Create a directory in your project called ``Quantitative Reasoning Reflection``.
* Inside that directory, create a new file called ``reflection.txt``. Don't create
  it as a Python file, because this isn't a Python program.
* In PyCharm, under the "File" menu, select "Settings...". Then find "Editor"
  and under that "Code Style." By default you could see a column guide set at
  120 characters. Set this to 80 for now.
* Add your name, date, and a title to the document. Failure to do this is a
  three point penalty.
* Don't write text beyond the 80 character limit. (Occasionally hitting 85
  isn't a big deal, but if you write 800 characters on a line, expect to
  get penalized.
* Use paragraphs. Most paragraphs are around five sentences long. While this
  isn't a hard and fast rule, if your paragraph has 22 sentences, chances are,
  something's wrong.
* Answer each question below. Commit and turn in just like a regular program.
  Use complete sentences and proper spelling. Label each question. Put a blank
  line between each question.

Questions
---------

Each question is worth five points. Make sure you have five good points as part
of your answer. I'd suggest drafting out five points, and then fill in the
points with proper sentences, grammar, and punctuation. Examples are encouraged.

1. Describe how you used multiple quantitative methods, techniques and algorithms
   to add functionality to your program.
   How did you decide what method to use?
   For example, how did you use lists? "If" statements? Loops? Classes? Functions?
   Sample pieces of code?
   How did you decide which methods to apply? Feel free to give examples.
2. Explain how you communicate your solution (from one programmer to another)
   when writing the code. Show how
   variable names matter, how function names matter, how comments and structure
   make your code easier to read.
3. How did you test and evaluate the accuracy of your code? When something didn't
   work, describe how you debugged what the error was. Also, how do you determine
   if data returned is correct data?
4. What are the limitations to using numerical methods to make decisions?
   For example, why can't we just replace humans with algorithms? Why can't we just evaluate students
   based solely on test scores? Why can't we evaluate teachers just on how their students
   do? What is the limitation to evaluating athletes just on their stats?
